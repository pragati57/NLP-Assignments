# NLP - Natural Language Processing

NLP has various applications, including Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Sentiment Analysis,  Text Summarization, Text Generation, and Topic Modelling.

Data cleaning is an important step in NLP that involves removing or correcting errors and inconsistencies in textual data to improve its quality and usability for analysis. The quality of NLP models depends largely on the quality of the data used to train them, so data cleaning is an essential process.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process of analyzing and understanding the data to uncover its underlying patterns, trends, and relationships. It is a critical step in the data analysis process that helps to identify potential problems with the data and inform further analysis.

Sentiment Analysis is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves the use of computational methods to identify and extract subjective information from text, such as opinions, attitudes, emotions, and feelings. It is also known as Opinion Mining or Emotion AI.

Text generation is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves using computational methods to generate new text that resembles human language. Text generation can be used for various applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and content creation.

Topic modeling is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying the hidden topics or themes within a corpus of text documents. The goal of topic modeling is to uncover the underlying semantic structure of the text data and group similar documents together based on their content.
